DeDRM_Standalone_App - DeDRM_App.pyw and DeDRM_Drop_Target.bat
===================================================

This is the DeDRM_App bundled with PyInstaller for Windows.

For usage information, see DeDRM_App_ReadMe.txt in the DeDRM_Windows_Application folder.
Just keep in mind nothing needs to be installed. No global Python 2.7 or PyCrypto or anything.

Start `DeDRM_App\DeDRM_App.exe` to run the GUI where settings can be set and saved and books can be selected for
processing.

With this build, there is no longer a "drop target batch file". Files can be directly dragged and dropped on the
`DeDRM_App.exe` executable.
