<h1>Managing Readium LCP passphrases</h1>

<p>Readium LCP is a relatively new eBook DRM. It's also known under the names "CARE DRM" or "TEA DRM". It does not rely on any accounts or key data that's difficult to acquire. All you need to open (or decrypt) LCP eBooks is the account passphrase given to you by the eBook provider - the very same passphrase you'd have to enter into your eBook reader device (once) to read LCP-encrypted books.</p>

<p>This plugin no longer supports removing the Readium LCP DRM due to a DMCA takedown request issued by Readium. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/01/2022-01-04-readium.md">takedown notice</a> or <a href="https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/issues/18">this bug report</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Entering an LCP passphrase:</h3>

<p>On the right-hand side of the plugin’s customization dialog, you will see a button with an icon that looks like a green plus sign (+). Clicking this button will open a new dialog for entering a new passphrase.</p>

<p>Just enter your passphrase as provided with the book, then click the OK button to save the passphrase. </p>

<p>Usually, passphrases are identical for all books bought with the same account. So if you buy multiple LCP-protected eBooks, they'll usually all have the same passphrase if they've all been bought at the same store with the same account. </p>

<h3>Deleting an LCP passphrase:</h3>

<p>On the right-hand side of the plugin’s customization dialog, you will see a button with an icon that looks like a red "X". Clicking this button will delete the highlighted passphrase from the list. You will be prompted once to be sure that’s what you truly mean to do. Once gone, it’s permanently gone.</p>

<p>Once done entering/deleting passphrases, click Close to exit the customization dialogue. Your changes will only be saved permanently when you click OK in the main configuration dialog.</p>
