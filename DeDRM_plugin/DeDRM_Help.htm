<h1>DeDRM Plugin <span class="version">(v10.0.3)</span></h1>

<p>This plugin removes DRM from ebooks when they are imported into calibre. If you already have DRMed ebooks in your calibre library, you will need to remove them and import them again.</p>

<p>It is a forked version created by NoDRM, based on the original plugin by Apprentice Alf and Apprentice Harper.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>You have obviously managed to install the plugin, as otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this help file. However, you should also delete any older DRM removal plugins, as this DeDRM plugin replaces the five older plugins: Kindle and Mobipocket DeDRM (K4MobiDeDRM), Ignoble Epub DeDRM (ignobleepub), Inept Epub DeDRM (ineptepub), Inept PDF DeDRM (ineptepub) and eReader PDB 2 PML (eReaderPDB2PML).</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>On Windows and Mac, the keys for ebooks downloaded for Kindle for Mac/PC and Adobe Digital Editions are automatically generated. If all your DRMed ebooks can be opened and read in Kindle for Mac/PC and/or Adobe Digital Editions on the same computer on which you are running calibre, you do not need to do any configuration of this plugin. On Linux, keys for Kindle for PC and Adobe Digital Editions need to be generated separately (see the Linux section below).</p>

<p>If you are using the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=341975">DeACSM / ACSM Input Plugin</a> for Calibre, the keys will also automatically be dumped for you.</p>

<p>If you have other DRMed ebooks, you will need to enter extra configuration information. The buttons in this dialog will open individual configuration dialogs that will allow you to enter the needed information, depending on the type and source of your DRMed eBooks. Additional help on the information required is available in each of the the dialogs.</p>

<p>If you have used previous versions of the various DeDRM plugins on this machine, you may find that some of the configuration dialogs already contain the information you entered through those previous plugins.</p>

<p>When you have finished entering your configuration information, you <em>must</em> click the OK button to save it. If you click the Cancel button, all your changes in all the configuration dialogs will be lost.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>

<p>If you find that it’s not working for you , you can save a lot of time by trying to add the ebook to Calibre in debug mode. This will print out a lot of helpful info that can be copied into any online help requests.</p>

<p>Open a command prompt (terminal window) and type "calibre-debug -g" (without the quotes). Calibre will launch, and you can can add the problem ebook the usual way. The debug info will be output to the original command prompt (terminal window). Copy the resulting output and paste it into the comment you make at my blog.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Note:</span> The Mac version of Calibre doesn’t install the command line tools by default. If you go to the ‘Preferences’ page and click on the miscellaneous button, you’ll find the option to install the command line tools.</p>

<h2>Linux Systems Only</h2>
<h3>Generating decryption keys for Adobe Digital Editions and Kindle for PC</h3>
<p>If you install Kindle for PC and/or Adobe Digital Editions in Wine, you will be able to download DRMed ebooks to them under Wine. To be able to remove the DRM, you will need to generate key files and add them in the plugin's customisation dialogs.</p>

<p>To generate the key files you will need to install Python and PyCrypto under the same Wine setup as your Kindle for PC and/or Adobe Digital Editions installations. (Kindle for PC, Python and Pycrypto installation instructions in the ReadMe.)</p>

<p>Once everything's installed under Wine, you'll need to run the adobekey.pyw script (for Adobe Digital Editions) and kindlekey.pyw (For Kindle for PC) using the python installation in your Wine system. The scripts can be found in Other_Tools/Key_Retrieval_Scripts.</p>

<p>Each script will create a key file in the same folder as the script. Copy the key files to your Linux system and then load the key files using the Adobe Digital Editions ebooks dialog and the Kindle for Mac/PC ebooks dialog.</p>
