# Revision history:
#   1 - Initial release
#   2 - LCP DRM code removed due to a DMCA takedown.

"""
This file used to contain code to remove the Readium LCP DRM
from eBooks. Unfortunately, Readium has issued a DMCA takedown 
request, so I was forced to remove that code: 

https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2022/01/2022-01-04-readium.md

This file now just returns an error message when asked to remove LCP DRM.
For more information, see this issue:
