Welcome to the tools!
=====================

This file is to give users a quick overview of what is available and how to get started. This document is part of the DeDRM Tools archive from noDRM's github repository: https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/

This archive includes calibre plugins to remove DRM from:

 - Kindle ebooks (files from Kindle for Mac/PC and eInk Kindles).
 - Adobe Digital Editions ePubs (including Kobo and Google ePubs downloaded to ADE)
 - Adobe Digital Editions PDFs
 - Kobo kePubs from the Kobo Desktop application and attached Kobo readers.

These tools do NOT work with Apple's iBooks FairPlay DRM. Use iBook Copy from TunesKit.
These tools no longer work well with books from Barnes & Noble.
Due to a DMCA request, these tools no longer work with LCP-encrypted books - see https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/issues/18 for details.

For limitations and work-arounds, see the FAQ at https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/blob/master/FAQs.md

About the tools
---------------
These tools are updated and maintained by noDRM and many others. They are based on Apprentice Harper's Calibre plugin. You can find the latest updates at noDRM's github repository https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/ and get support by creating an issue at the repository (github account required).

If you re-post these tools, a link to the repository would be appreciated.

The tools are provided in the form of plugins for calibre. Calibre is an open source freeware ebook library manager. It is the best tool around for keeping track of your ebooks.


DeDRM plugin for calibre (Linux, Mac OS X and Windows)
-------------------------------------------------------
calibe 5.x and later are now written in Python 3, and plugins must also use Python 3. 

The DeDRM plugin for calibre removes DRM from your Kindle and Adobe DRM ebooks when they are imported to calibre. Just install the DeDRM plugin (DeDRM_plugin.zip), following the instructions and configuration directions provided in the ReadMe file and the help links in the plugin's configuration dialogs.

Once installed and configured, you can simply add a DRM book to calibre and a DRM-free version will be imported into the calibre database. Note that DRM removal only occurs on IMPORT not on CONVERSION or at any other time. If you have already imported DRMed books you'll need to remove the books from calibre and re-import them.


Obok plugin for calibre (Mac OS X and Windows)
----------------------------------------------
To import ebooks from the Kobo Desktop app or from a Kobo ebook reader, install the Obok plugin. This works in a different way to the DeDRM plugin, in that it finds your ebooks downloaded using the Kobo Desktop app, or on an attached Kobo ebooks reader, and displays them in a list, so that you can choose the ones you want to import into calibre.

For instructions, see the obok_plugin_ReadMe.txt file.
