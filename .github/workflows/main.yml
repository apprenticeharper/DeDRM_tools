            This release is automatically generated by Github for each commit. 

            This means, every time a change is made to the repo, a release with an untested copy of the plugin at that stage will be created. This will contain the most up-to-date code, but it's not tested at all and may be broken.

            Last update based on Git commit [${{ github.sha }}](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/commit/${{ github.sha }}).
          prerelease: true
          draft: false
