Hello,
I am a user and bought Kindle ebooks on Amazon. They are KFX-ZIP files. I wanted to use Calibre to convert to epub.
I used a Kindle PC version 1.24 to import, I charged DeDRM plugin 7.0.0 and a KFX Input from 18/11/20.
I succeeded to open some ebooks in Calibre as KFX, so I could convert them to epub.
But I have 4 books bought recently wich remain with KFX-ZIP extensions and I could not do anything in Calibre.
I don't know what to do because I tried to follow all what explained in this forum.
If you want I can send you one book which can not be converted.
Could you please help ?
Thanks a lot,
Karine
